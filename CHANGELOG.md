# Changelog

## [0.10.2](https://github.com/UXPLIMA/uxm-essentials/compare/v0.10.1...v0.10.2) (2026-10-27)

### Added

- The bossbar module: bars that stay up, timed bars and announced bars. Bars reach placeholders, the API and REST, a rotating frame is read in each player's language, and a visibility event is published.
- The pause-menu link labels are read in each player's language, and the links are sent again when a player chooses another language.

### Changed

- Every skin name opens unless the operator restricts it, and the console can dress another player.
- Menus play the sounds `config.conf` names, and every shipped window is filled with the house filler.
- Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` again, and the jars and a `SHA256SUMS` file are attached to every release. Commands, permissions, configuration files and stored data stay as they were.

### Fixed

- The worlds module reaches every dimension of Paper 26.2. A world can be named by its key (`minecraft:the_nether`, `mypack:mining`), by the bare path of the nether or end (`the_nether`), or by the name the server gives it (`world_nether`, `mypack_mining`). A datapack dimension is found under its own namespace and loads from there on every start.
- `/worlds import` reads the environment from the dimension when none is given, instead of answering "Unknown or incomplete command".
- A player's HUD keeps drawing after the server drops one of their renders.

## 0.0.1 (2026-10-27)

### Changed

- Versions restart at 0.0.1 under the UXPLIMA repository standard. Commands, permissions, configuration files and stored data stay as they were.
- The jar and a `SHA256SUMS` file are attached to every release.
